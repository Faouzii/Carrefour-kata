# Carrefour Discount MVP ‚Äî Business Rules & Demo Notes

This project demonstrates a shopping cart with discount code functionality for Carrefour, focusing on clear business rules and extensible discount logic.

## üõí Business Rules
- **One discount per cart:** Only one discount code can be applied at a time. Applying a new code replaces the previous one.
- **Product eligibility:**
  - Most discounts apply only to food products (see below).
  - Electronics are excluded from most discounts.
  - Some codes are product-specific (see table).
- **Discount code validation:**
  - Invalid codes show an error 
  - Discounts may have expiration dates.
- **Discount calculation:**
  - The backend uses the Strategy design pattern, making it easy to add new discount types.
